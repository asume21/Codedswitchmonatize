## 📊 **QUICK REFERENCE**

```typescript
// Copy this into your code:
const GOLDEN_FORMULA = {
  profitMargin: 2.5,        // 150% profit
  creditValue: 0.04,        // Average $/credit
  safetyBuffer: 1.5,        // 150% buffer

  calculate: (apiCost: number) => Math.ceil((apiCost * 2.5) / 0.04)
};
