  "recentChanges": [
    "Installed RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) locally on D:\\RVC with PyTorch + CUDA 12.4",
    "Created RVC API wrapper (rvc_api.py) on port 7870 for voice conversion",
    "Created Audio Analysis API (audio_analysis_api.py) on port 7871 with: pitch correction (auto-tune), melody extraction (vocals to MIDI), karaoke scoring, emotion detection, audio classification",
    "Wired both APIs to CodedSwitch backend via server/services/audioAnalysis.ts and server/services/speechCorrection.ts",
    "Added 6 new backend endpoints under /api/audio-analysis/*",
    "Both APIs running and tested - GPU (GTX 1050 Ti) working with half-precision",
    "Created startup scripts: start-api.bat and start-analysis-api.bat",
    "Updated README-API.md with full documentation"
  ],
  "notes": "RVC and Audio Analysis APIs are LOCAL-ONLY (run on user's machine with GPU). They provide: voice cloning/conversion, auto-tune, melody-to-MIDI, karaoke scoring, emotion detection, audio classification. CodedSwitch backend gracefully falls back if APIs unavailable. User still needs to add voice models (.pth files) to D:\\\\RVC\\\\assets\\\\weights\\\\ for voice conversion to work.",
