Added touch-seek on waveforms for mobile. Added band/podcast track templates in Add Track dialog.\n- Legacy routes: added README flagging server/routes/* as unused; added warning comment in server/routes/index.ts to prevent edits to dead paths.\nNext up: remaining UI polish (shortcuts/touch elsewhere, fades) and routing cleanup.",
