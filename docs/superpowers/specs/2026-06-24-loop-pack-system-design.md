# Loop Pack System — Design Spec
_2026-06-24_

## Problem

The Organism's generators compose notes dynamically in real time. This is hard to make consistently sound professional — quality depends on algorithm choices, and the result can feel mechanical. The user needs a **guaranteed fire beat** they can record and post without tuning knobs.

## Solution

A standalone **Loop Pack System**: pre-produced audio loops organized into genre packs, distributed to and played by the existing generators. When Loops Mode is ON, each generator swaps its compose-notes logic for play-this-loop. Everything else — audio routing, MixEngine, section energy, volume faders — stays identical.

The user sees no new UI complexity: same genre picker, same Organism controls, one new **Loops Mode** toggle. The sound is guaranteed because every loop in a pack was produced to work together (same BPM, same key, same vibe).

## Architecture

### 1. Pack Format

A pack is a JSON manifest + a folder of audio files (WAV, hosted on GCS/S3). Stored at `/api/loops/packs/:id`.

```ts
interface LoopPack {
  id:     string               // e.g. "hip-hop-classic"
  genre:  string               // matches QuickStartPreset.genre
  bpm:    number               // session BPM locks to this when pack is active
  key:    string               // e.g. "C", "Am"
  label:  string               // display name
  loops: {
    drums:   LoopClip[]
    bass:    LoopClip[]
    melody:  LoopClip[]
    chords:  LoopClip[]
    texture: LoopClip[]        // pads, atmospheres, other
  }
}

interface LoopClip {
  id:   string
  url:  string                 // absolute GCS/S3 URL
  bars: number                 // loop length in bars (2, 4, or 8)
  label?: string               // optional human name
}
```

Each genre's `QuickStartPreset` gets one new optional field:

```ts
loopPackId?: string            // ID of the pack to load in Loops Mode
```

Packs are fetched via `/api/loops/packs/:id` (public endpoint — no auth required, same as `/api/loops`). The server reads pack manifests from GCS/S3 or a local JSON file in dev.

**Pack sizes:** 12–24 loops per pack. Minimum viable pack: 2 drum + 2 bass + 3 melody + 2 chord + 1 texture = 10 loops. Full pack: up to 24.

---

### 2. Generator Loop Mode

Each generator gets two new methods. No changes to existing generate/compose logic.

```ts
// Added to every generator (Drum, Bass, Melody, Chord, Texture)
loadLoop(clip: LoopClip): Promise<void>   // preloads audio, ready to play
setLoopMode(enabled: boolean): void       // switch between compose and loop playback
```

When `loopMode = true`:
- The generator's `processFrame` / `scheduleNext` plays the loaded `Tone.Player` loop instead of composing
- The loop is set to `loop: true` on the `Tone.Player`, quantized to bar boundaries
- All existing routing stays: generator output → generator's MixEngine channel → master bus
- Section orchestration still applies: if the plan says drums are `'out'`, the drum loop's volume is floored to 0 via `roleCeiling()` (no code change needed — this is already wired)

When `loopMode = false`:
- Generator resumes composing as normal (existing behavior)
- The loaded `Tone.Player` is stopped and released

**Loop sync:** `Tone.Player` is started at the next bar boundary via `Tone.Transport.scheduleOnce(() => player.start(), '@1m')`. This guarantees clicks-free, in-time entry.

---

### 3. GeneratorOrchestrator — pack distribution

One new method on `GeneratorOrchestrator`:

```ts
loadLoopPack(pack: LoopPack): Promise<void>
```

Steps:
1. For each instrument type (drums/bass/melody/chords/texture), picks the first available clip from the pack (AI or simple round-robin — see §4)
2. Calls `generator.loadLoop(clip)` on each generator in parallel
3. Calls `generator.setLoopMode(true)` on all generators once loaded
4. Adjusts `Tone.Transport.bpm.value` to match `pack.bpm`

```ts
clearLoopPack(): void
```

Steps:
1. Calls `generator.setLoopMode(false)` on all generators
2. Releases preloaded audio
3. Restores session BPM

---

### 4. Loop Selection (AI direction)

For V1: simple **round-robin / random pick** from each instrument pool within the pack. The pack is small enough (2–4 per type) that any pick sounds good — that's the point of the pack.

Future (not this spec): the Conductor or a lightweight LLM call picks which loop variant fits the current section energy (e.g., sparse drum loop for intro, heavy variant for drop). The interface (`loadLoop(clip)`) already supports hot-swapping at section boundaries.

---

### 5. OrganismProvider — mode toggle

One new boolean:

```ts
const [loopsModeEnabled, setLoopsModeEnabled] = useState(false)
```

When toggled ON:
1. Fetch the pack for the current preset's `loopPackId`
2. Call `orchestrator.loadLoopPack(pack)` — generators keep composing during the 1–2s load so there's no silence gap; loop mode activates once all clips are buffered
3. If no `loopPackId` exists for this preset, log a warning and stay in generate mode silently

When toggled OFF:
1. Call `orchestrator.clearLoopPack()`
2. Generators resume normal compose mode

**UI:** One **"Loops"** toggle button in the existing Organism controls bar. No other UI change. If no pack exists for the current genre, the button is greyed out with a tooltip "No pack available for this genre yet."

---

### 6. Server — pack API

New route added to the existing `/api/loops` router:

```
GET /api/loops/packs           → list available packs (id, genre, label, bpm, key)
GET /api/loops/packs/:id       → full pack manifest with loop URLs
```

Public endpoint (no auth). Pack manifests are either:
- **Dev:** JSON files in `server/data/loop-packs/`
- **Prod:** fetched from GCS/S3 bucket `codedswitchmonatize-loop-packs`

No database table needed in V1 — manifests are static JSON files. A future admin UI can manage them.

## File Map

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `shared/loopPack.ts` | NEW — `LoopPack`, `LoopClip` types |
| `server/data/loop-packs/` | NEW — JSON manifests (dev) |
| `server/routes/loops.ts` | ADD `/packs` and `/packs/:id` routes |
| `server/index.ts` | Already public — no change needed |

| `client/src/organism/generators/BassGenerator.ts` | ADD `loadLoop`, `setLoopMode` |

| `client/src/features/organism/OrganismProvider.tsx` | ADD `loopsModeEnabled`, fetch + load pack |
| Organism UI controls | ADD "Loops" toggle button |

## What This Is NOT

- No new audio engine or synthesis path
- No changes to MixEngine, MasterBus, or audio routing
- No changes to the Conductor, ArrangementPlan, or section system
- No user-facing loop grid or box visualization (that's future)
- No loop generation — loops are pre-made audio files
- No generator replacement — generators keep all existing logic; loop mode is an additive flag

---

## Success Criteria

1. User toggles Loops Mode ON → Organism starts playing a fire beat within 2 seconds
2. Beat is locked to pack BPM, all loops in time
3. Toggle OFF → generators resume composing, no audio glitch
4. User can record the output (existing record flow unchanged)
5. No crash when a genre has no pack yet (silent fallback to generate mode)
